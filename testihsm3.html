                    Take my hand, take a breath</br>
                    Pull me close and take one step</br>
                    Keep your eyes locked on mine,</br>
                    And let the music be your guide</br>.
                    Won't you promise me (now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget)</br>
                    We'll keep dancing (to keep dancing) wherever we go next</br>
                    It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you</br>

                        Where's the mirror</br>
                        I think this tux is too baggy, too tight</br>
                        It makes me look weird</br>

                        Sassy or sweet?</br>

                        Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.</br>
                        I guess I should've known better,</br>
                        to believe I'm a lucky chain, Oh.</br>
                        I lent my heart out forever,</br>
                        and finally learned each other's names.</br>
                        I tell myself, "this time it's different."</br>
                        No goodbyes, cause eyes can't bear to say it.</br>
                        "I'll never survive on one that's coming",</br>
                        If I stay, Ooh!</br>
                        Just Walk Away! Ooh, and don't look back.</br>
                        Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad.</br>
                        You know I'm strong, but I can't take that.</br>
                        Before It's too late. Oh, just Walk Away!</br>
                        (Walk, Walk, Walk Away) Ooh, just Walk Away!</br>
                        (Walk, Walk, Walk) Away-aye-aye, yeah.</br>
                        I really wish I could blame you, but I know</br>
                        That it's no one's fault. No, No. No, No</br>
                        Cinderella with no shoe, and</br>
                        the prince that doesn't know he's lost.</br>
                        He says that her face is so familiar, and</br>
                        Goodbye with just the same old song.</br>
                        But this time I will not surrender!</br>
                        Just Walk Away! Ooh, and don't look back.</br>
                        Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad.</br>
                        You know I'm strong, but I can't take that.</br>

                        (Walk, Walk, Walk) Away-aye-aye, yeah.</br>
                        Ooh, I've got to let it go.</br>
                        Start protecting my heart and soul.</br>
                        Cause I don't think I'll survive a goodbye again.</br>
                        Not again!</br>

                    The day a door is closed</br>
The echoes fill your soul</br>
They won't say which way to go</br>
Just trust your heart</br>
To find you're here for</br>
Open another door</br>
But i'm not sure anymore</br>
It's just so hard</br>
Voices in my head</br>
Tell me they know best</br>
Got me on the edge</br>
they're pushin', pushin',</br>
they're pushin'</br>
I know they've got a plan</br>
But the balls in my hands</br>
This time its man-to-man,</br>
I'm driving, fighting inside</br>
A world that's upside down</br>
Spinning faster</br>
What do I do now? Without you</br>
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?</br>
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?</br>
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
I'm kickin' down the walls</br>
I gotta make 'em fall</br>
Just break through them all</br>
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna</br>
Fight to find myself</br>
Me and no one else</br>
Which way? I can't tell,</br>
I'm searchin', searchin', can't find the</br>
Road that I should take</br>
I should! turn right or left is</br>
It's like nothing works without you</br>
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?</br>
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?</br>
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
Yeah, the clock's running down,</br>
hear the crowd gettin' loud!</br>
I'm consumed by the sound!</br>
Is it her? Is it love?</br>
Can the music ever be enough?</br>
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out!</br>
You can do it, you can do it!</br>
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?</br>
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?</br>
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?</br>
I want my own thing. I want my own thing!</br>
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?</br>
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</br>
Ohh! Ahh!!!!</br>
